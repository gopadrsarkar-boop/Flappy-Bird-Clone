This is a flappy bird clone built using python and the pygame library.
I am Abhi, the creator of this project. 
All the audio files were taken from Zedge and the image files were drawn by me(I know they are bad).
This project uses infinite loops, for loops, if-else statements.
It uses the mixer import for keeping check of the sounds.
It loops the background music ith a -1.
You can also choose and change the background of the game if you want to by pressing the m,n,b,v,c keys and eack give a separate background.
Also, I am 13 (don't know why I told that).
