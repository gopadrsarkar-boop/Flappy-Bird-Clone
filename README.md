This is a flappy bird clone built using python and the pygame library.
I am Abhi, the creator of this project. 
All the audio files were taken from Zedge and the image files were drawn by me(I know they are bad).
This project uses infinite loops, for loops, if-else statements.
It uses the mixer import for keeping check of the sounds.
It loops the background music ith a -1.
